# Breadth between S&P500 and the tech giant stocks Post-Covid
The concentration of five tech giants, namely Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Google in the S&amp;P500 have increased significantly. It is a common view on the street that the concentration level has surpassed that during the Dot-com bubble in 1999. Thus, extracting the time series data set for cumulative stock price of the above tech stocks and S&amp;P500, we would compute and plot the cumulative daily returns on tech stocks that are driving the raging market, as well as the S&amp;P500. Then, we would compute the breadth between the major tech stocks and S&amp;P500.
